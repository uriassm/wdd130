    <h2>Urias Miranda</h2>
    <p>
        Hello everyone, my name is Urias Miranda. I currently live in California with my wife and son. 
        We have been married for six years and our son is eighteen months old. I am currently pursuing
        studies in computer programming and of course web development. I really hope to find a new
        career path with these skills as software and computers have always been a great interest of
        mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently do hold a full time job besides being a father, however I do love both responsibilities. 
        I also have a calling in our stake that allows me to share some talents with others that I find to be 
        a great blessing. If I can ever find some spare time I enjoy going out for runs or on the flipside, 
        playing video games with family or friends. I also enjoy food and going out to eat!
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been a member of the church most of my life and my favorite scripture is Ether 12:4 which speaks of 
        hope being an anchor to our souls. I feel that as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
        we can all have hope in the Plan of Salvation that our Heavenly Father has created for us. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am grateful to meet all of you and hope we can help one another find success throughout the semester!
