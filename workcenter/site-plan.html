      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you ever feel that important training information gets lost too soon when introducing new concepts to your team at work? Does outdated information sit too long on 
          the desk of one of your team members? It's so easy in the normal work day for a printed memo to be shoved in a growing stack of papers. Passing out paper every time there is 
          an update always comes with these risks. It would be more effective to have single source of current information that team members can always have access to. This is where 
          an internal website comes in. A place where guides, updates, and important information can be maintained so everyone on your team can have the needed knowledge to work towards a 
          unified goal.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience are those who work in a professional setting. They work in a team that constantly need to communicate and have reliable access to a computer or device that
        has internet connectivity. The site gives team members confidence that they are viewing reliable information. It will help managers feel capable of keeping their team together and on 
        the same page. The site is easy to navigate to ensure all team members feel comfortable finding needed information. </p>  <!-- change this -->
